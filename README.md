TEIExplorer: A stupid tool to explore and compare XML/TEI corpus
=================================================================

*In development*

When exploring a corpus of documents XML/TEI, one may need to
know what texts are similar, and on what basis.
This package intend to become a suite for text comparison.
It will allow to:
    - Read and store metadata information of each XML/TEI document
      e.g. :
         • Header metadata: Title, Author(s),...
         • Body metrics: #words, #sentences, polarity, ...
    - Run an unsupervised comparing tool for a set of texts (To be done).

This tool is being developed as part of the OBVIL projects.
See http://obvil.paris-sorbonne.fr/

For the moment, it is dirty and can't be used.
